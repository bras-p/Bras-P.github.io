SGLD algorithms consist in a stochastic gradient descent with exogenous noise added in order to escape local minima and saddle points. Contrary to the classic Langevin Stochastic Differential Equation, we study the case where the exogenous noise is adaptive i.e. not constant but depends on the position of the procedure. In a first part we prove the convergence of SGLD algorithms for the L1-Wasserstein distance and for the Total Variation distance. In a second part we apply SGLD algorithms to optimization and inference problems arising in Machine Learning and in Numerical Probability and we introduce the Layer Langevin algorithm. A last part is devoted to the numerical simulation of stochastic processes.","tags":["Stochastic Optimization","Gradient Descent","Langevin Dynamics","Simulated Annealing","Machine Learning","Deep Learning","Neural Networks","Euler-Maruyama Scheme","Bayesian Inference","Stochastic Control","Monte Carlo","MCMC"],"title":"Adaptive Gradient Langevin Algorithms for Stochastic Optimization and Bayesian Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pierre Bras","Gilles Pagès"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1690156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690156800,"objectID":"a98eba3d8473ea2c32d93e4794036d61","permalink":"https://Bras-P.github.io/publication/correlation_optimal/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/correlation_optimal/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a new algorithm for variance reduction when estimating f(XT) where X is the solution to some stochastic differential equation and f is a test function.

These explicit expressions rely on infinite oscillating sums of Bessel functions and may demand computationally costly procedures. We propose suitable recursive algorithms for the simulation of the laws of reflected and stopped Brownian motion which are based on generalizations of the reflection principle in two dimensions. We study and give bounds for the complexity of the proposed algorithms.","tags":["Simulation","Monte Carlo","Reflected Brownian motion"],"title":"Simulation of Reflected Brownian motion on two dimensional wedges","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Slides\n","date":1621526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621526400,"objectID":"39c23021344b981d84b371c434f54c81","permalink":"https://Bras-P.github.io/talk/seminaire-doctorants/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/seminaire-doctorants/","section":"event","summary":"Convergence rates of Gibbs measures with degenerate minimum","tags":[],"title":"Séminaire doctorants","type":"event"},{"authors":["Pierre Bras"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1612310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612310400,"objectID":"c1dcf42f20519e8bf9f3779ba7e239ca","permalink":"https://Bras-P.github.io/publication/hilbert/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hilbert/","section":"publication","summary":"We study convergence rates for Gibbs measures, with density proportional to e−f(x)/t, as t→0 where f:Rd→R admits a unique global minimum at x⋆. We focus on the case where the Hessian is not definite at x⋆. We assume instead that the minimum is strictly polynomial and give a higher order nested expansion of f at x⋆, which depends on every coordinate. We give an algorithm yielding such a decomposition if the polynomial order of x⋆ is no more than 8, in connection with Hilbert's 17th problem. However, we prove that the case where the order is 10 or higher is fundamentally different and that further assumptions are needed. We then give the rate of convergence of Gibbs measures using this expansion. Finally we adapt our results to the multiple well case.","tags":["Gibbs measures","Stochastic optimization"],"title":"Convergence rates of Gibbs measures with degenerate minimum","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;\rif porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;:\rprint(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)\rMath In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\rPress Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\rPress the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}\rCustom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\rQuestions?
